# Render Build Fix - Python 3.13 Compatibility

## Problem
The initial Render deployment failed with this error:
```
error: subprocess-exited-with-error
KeyError: '__version__'
Getting requirements to build wheel did not run successfully.
```

**Root Cause:** Pillow 10.1.0 cannot be built from source on Python 3.13. Pillow requires a compiler and can fail if build dependencies aren't available.

## Solution
Updated `requirements.txt` with compatible versions:

### Changes Made
```diff
- Pillow==10.1.0
+ Pillow==11.0.0
+ gunicorn==23.0.0
```

### Why This Works
1. **Pillow 11.0.0** - Has pre-built wheels for Python 3.13 (no compilation needed)
2. **gunicorn==23.0.0** - Latest stable version compatible with all dependencies

## Updated requirements.txt
```txt
Flask==3.1.2
flask-cors==6.0.1
python-dotenv==1.2.0
requests==2.32.5
Werkzeug==3.1.3
google-generativeai==0.7.0
Pillow==11.0.0
gunicorn==23.0.0
```

## Next Steps for Render Deployment

1. **Render should automatically redeploy** after detecting the git push
2. **If not, manually trigger:**
   - Go to Render Dashboard
   - Click your service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

3. **Monitor the build:**
   - Go to "Logs" tab
   - Should see: `✓ Installing Python version 3.13.4`
   - Should see: `✓ Running build command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'`
   - Should complete without errors ✅

## Success Indicators
- ✅ Build succeeds (no subprocess errors)
- ✅ All dependencies install
- ✅ Flask server starts
- ✅ API endpoint responds at `https://your-service.onrender.com/api/conversations`

## Testing After Deployment

```bash
# Test backend is running
curl https://your-service.onrender.com/api/conversations

# Expected response:
# []

# Or open in browser:
# https://your-service.onrender.com/api/conversations
```

## If Still Failing
Check:
1. Environment variables are set (GEMINI_API_KEY)
2. Start Command: `gunicorn app:app`
3. Python version: 3.13.4
4. Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Technical Details
- **Pillow 11.0.0** uses modern build system with pre-compiled wheels
- **Python 3.13** is officially supported by Pillow 11.0+
- **Pre-built wheels** install instantly (no compilation)
- **Faster deploy** = better cold start performance
